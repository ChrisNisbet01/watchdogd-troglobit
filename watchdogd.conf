# The supervisor is not only responsible for supervising subscribing
# processes, but also for storing the reset cause and reset counter.
# This is disabled by default since not all systems allow writing to
# disk, which the default rcfile.c backend does.  E.g. e.g. embedded
# systems using MTD devices with limited number of write cycles.
#
# The file setting below must be uncommented to enable the backend.
# It can be changed to another location, but make sure that location
# is writable first.  Another backend can be implemented and linked
# to watchdogd, --disable-rcfile with the configure script first.
#
# When process subscribes to be monitored by the supervisor we change
# to SCHED_RR and set the realtime priority using the below value.
#supervisor {
#    file     = "/var/lib/watchdogd.state"
